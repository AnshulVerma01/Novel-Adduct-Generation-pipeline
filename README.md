# Novel Adduct Generation Pipeline

Genotoxins can form DNA adducts by covalently binding to cellular DNA, leading to structural and functional changes that disrupt cellular processes. These disruptions can occur through genetic mechanisms (e.g., mutations) or non-genetic mechanisms (e.g., epigenetic modifications). The identification, quantification, and characterization of DNA adducts are critical for understanding their biological impact and can accelerate efforts to predict carcinogenicity and elucidate their modes of action.

This pipeline leverages computational strategies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based modeling, to advance the study of DNA adducts. These approaches enable predictive modeling for adduct formation via metabolic activation and the identification of novel adducts, providing valuable insights into their biological significance and role in genotoxicity.
